## Procedures
General Process
This section describes the standard process for creating a one-off quotation, converting it into a booking, and converting the booking into a shipment whilst attaching it to a consolidation.
This process applies to all transport modes, including airfreight, ocean freight, and road transportation. The instructions in this section provide a high-level overview of the steps involved in this process, and they should be used in conjunction with the detailed instructions provided in the rest of this SOP under each different transportation mode and type.


Below is a graphical representation of how the high-level process of creating a new shipment for a customer – from the first quotation given, to converting that to a booking and finally, after the customers approval, convert it to a shipment with a consolidation.




First create a one-off quotation:
Navigate to “Manage”  “Tariff & Rates”  “One off Quotes”
In the "One Off Quote" screen, click the "New" button to create a new quote.
Enter the relevant information that pertains to the movement (air, ocean, road), such as the origin and destination, the type of goods being shipped, and any special requirements or instructions. For a complete list of required and relevant information, refer to the specific SOP in table #1.
Once the quote is complete, click the "Save" button to save it.
To send the quotation to the client, click on the “Print” button. Click “No” to finalize the quote to send it to the client in a draft status. If you finalize it, the quote will be locked for further changes.


Once that is accepted by the client, convert it to a booking:
Open the One-Off quote and click on the “Convert to Booking with Quote” button in the bottom bar.
Enter the relevant information that pertains to the movement (air, ocean, road), such as the client's details and the details of the shipment. For a complete list of required and relevant information, refer to the specific SOP in table #1.
Once the booking is complete, click the "Save" button to save it and send a booking confirmation to the client.
When the client accepts the booking, convert the booking into a shipment and fill in the rest of the details:
Open the booking and click on “Actions”  “Consolidate” in the top bar to convert the booking into a shipment, and in the same instance add that shipment to a new consolidation.
Fill out the remaining information on the consolidation level and navigate to the shipment to do the same. For a complete list of required and relevant information, refer to the specific SOP in table #1.


This is a very brief and high-level overview that shows the lifecycle of a shipment in CargoWise One.
Related Parties
A shipment / consolidation has multiple different parties involved. This can for example be the shipper, consignee, local client, pickup transport company and so on.  For billing- and data quality purposes it is very important that the parties are entered correctly and are reflecting the real-life shipment.
Local client vs Shipper vs Consignee
By design, the Local client will default based on Direction EXP /IMP and the ''Shipper Entity'' (this can be overridden if required but may then have some negative implications). Essentially a Local client is always either a Shipper or a Consignee (very rarely a Forwarder - very odd cases only).
Below are two examples (one for export and one for import). The examples are shown on booking level, but the same mechanism apply on shipments.
You should be aware that if manipulated, your own billing defaults and that of your NTG partner will likely not work as intended.
Example for Export
Local Client t will default to the Danish Shipper Entity when you save the booking.


Example for Import
Local Client t will default to the Danish Consignee Entity when you the booking.




Forwarder/Agents
A forwarder/agent is not a local client and should not be entered as such. A forwarder/agent is a partner we bill (also known as a “Transport Client”).
Therefore, the only place a Forwarder/Agent should appear in a Shipment will be on either a Notify Party or the Overseas Agent in the Billing Screen.
Controlling Office (Shared shipments on the database)
There is a dimension on ownership of files and “who does what” in terms of origin and destination offices.
Below tables shows who’s responsible for what in any type of transport scenario:




Consol / Shipment Combinations
Further, you can refer to the below table that refers to the possible consol/shipment combinations in CargoWise One based on different criteria:





The process described in this document is showing a high-level how the process flows from quotation to final shipment.

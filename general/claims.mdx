This will pull all relevant information from the shipment and generate a claim notification document.

# Adding custom remarks

You can add custom remarks to your claim notification document by going to the "Notes" tab on the shipment, and adding a custom note called "Claim Notification Document". In this note you can write whatever custom text you need to appear on the document:

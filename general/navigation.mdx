## Search Filters

Common for all modules, the search feature allows users to quickly search through records using various filters. To utilize the search filters effectively, follow these steps:

- To apply a filter, simply enter your criteria in the appropriate field. You can use the `contains` or other operators to refine your search.
- You can select multiple filters, by clicking on the "+" icon, and you can remove filters by clicking on the "-" icon next to the filter.
- After entering your search criteria, click on the `Search` button to retrieve the results.

The results will display in the main panel, showing only the records that match your filters.

Example:
<Frame>

</Frame>

### Tips for Effective Searching:

- Use the `Reset` button to clear all filters and start a new search.
- Combine multiple filters to narrow down your results to the most relevant shipments.
- Remember that some filters may have additional options that can be accessed by clicking on the dropdown arrow next to the filter name.

For more detailed searches, you can utilize advanced search options by clicking on the `Advanced Search` link (if available). This will allow you to use more specific criteria and combine various fields for a comprehensive search.

Remember to utilize the `Help` button for additional guidance on using search filters within the CargoWise One platform.
